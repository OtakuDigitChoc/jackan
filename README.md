Jackan supports installations of CKAN â‰¥ 2.2a. Although officially the web api version used is always the _v3_, unfortunately CKAN instances behave quite differently from each other according to their software version. So we periodically test Jackan against a list of existing catalogs all over the world. If you're experiencing problems with Jackan, [let us know](https://github.com/opendatatrentino/jackan/issues), if the error occurs in several catalogs we might devote some time to fix it.
